<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adsorption Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Simple Adsorption Dryer</li><li>Regenerative Adsorption Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adsorption dryers generally fall into two main types: Simple Adsorption Dryers and Regenerative Adsorption Dryers. </p><p>Simple Adsorption Dryers work by passing the compressed air through a desiccant material that adsorbs the moisture, resulting in dry air output. </p><p>Regenerative Adsorption Dryers involve a more complex process where the desiccant material is periodically regenerated by heating it to release the absorbed moisture. This allows the desiccant material to be reused multiple times, making Regenerative Adsorption Dryers more efficient for continuous use.</p></p>
