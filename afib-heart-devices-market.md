<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Afib Heart Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation Devices</li><li>Maze Surgery Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Catheter ablation devices are used in minimally invasive procedures to treat atrial fibrillation (Afib) by destroying abnormal heart tissue. Maze surgery devices, on the other hand, are utilized in a more invasive procedure called the Maze surgery, where a series of incisions are made on the heart to create scar tissue that disrupts abnormal electrical signals. Both types of devices aim to restore normal heart rhythm in patients with Afib, but differ in the invasiveness of the procedure.</p></p>
