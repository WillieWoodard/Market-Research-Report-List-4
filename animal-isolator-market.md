<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Animal isolators are specialized enclosures used to house animals in a controlled environment. Positive pressure isolators maintain a higher air pressure inside the unit than outside, preventing contaminants from entering. Negative pressure isolators have lower air pressure inside, containing any potential hazards within the unit. Positive pressure isolators are commonly used for germ-free or specific pathogen-free animal research, while negative pressure isolators are more suitable for biohazard containment. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the health and safety of research animals.</p></p>
