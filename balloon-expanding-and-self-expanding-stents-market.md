<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon Expanding and Self-Expanding Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon Expanding Stents are a type of stent that is inserted into a narrowed or blocked artery and then expanded using a balloon catheter. The expansion helps to open up the artery and improve blood flow. On the other hand, Self-Expanding Stents are designed to expand on their own once inserted into the artery, without the need for a balloon catheter. Both types of stents are used in the treatment of conditions such as heart disease and peripheral arterial disease.</p></p>
