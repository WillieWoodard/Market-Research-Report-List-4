<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes for Guided Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes for guided bone regeneration are used in dental surgeries to prevent soft tissue from infiltrating bone defects and promote bone growth. The market is divided into absorbable membranes, which are broken down by the body over time, and non-absorbable membranes, which require surgical removal. Absorbable membranes are preferred for their convenience and reduced risk of complications, while non-absorbable membranes are chosen for their longer-lasting barrier function. Both types play a crucial role in promoting successful bone regeneration in dental procedures.</p></p>
