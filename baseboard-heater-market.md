<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Baseboard Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric</li><li>Hydronic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Baseboard heaters are commonly categorized into two main types: electric and hydronic. Electric baseboard heaters work by using electricity to heat up metal elements within the unit, which then radiates heat into the room. On the other hand, hydronic baseboard heaters use a liquid, typically water or oil, to transfer heat from a boiler through pipes to the unit, where it is then dispersed into the room. Both types of baseboard heaters are popular choices for providing supplemental heat in residential and commercial spaces.</p></p>
