<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Cautery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Devices</li><li>Bipolar Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrosurgical cautery devices are used for cutting, coagulating, and cauterizing tissue during surgical procedures. Monopolar devices use a single electrode to deliver high-frequency electrical current through the patient's body to the grounding pad, while bipolar devices have two electrodes that deliver the current directly to the target tissue. Monopolar devices are more versatile and can be used for a wide range of procedures, while bipolar devices are safer for delicate procedures as they limit damage to surrounding tissue. Both types of devices are essential tools in modern surgery.</p></p>
