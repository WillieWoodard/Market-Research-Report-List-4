<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flight Data Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Board</li><li>On Ground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flight Data Monitoring System (FDMS) can be classified into two main types: On Board and On Ground. The On Board system involves real-time monitoring and recording of flight data directly on the aircraft, providing immediate access to information during the flight. On the other hand, the On Ground system collects data after the flight has landed, allowing for analysis and review of flight data at a later time. Both types of FDMS play a crucial role in enhancing safety, efficiency, and compliance within the aviation industry.</p></p>
