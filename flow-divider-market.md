<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flow Divider Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volumetric Flow</li><li>Mass Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flow dividers can be classified into two main types based on how they divide the flow of fluid: volumetric flow dividers and mass flow dividers. Volumetric flow dividers split the fluid into equal volumes, ensuring each output receives the same amount of fluid. On the other hand, mass flow dividers divide the fluid based on mass, ensuring each output receives an equal mass of fluid. Both types of flow dividers are crucial for maintaining consistency and precision in various industrial applications.</p></p>
