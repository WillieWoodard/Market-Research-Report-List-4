<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>De-Icing Systems</li><li>Anti-Icing Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ice Protection Systems are designed to prevent the formation of ice on aircraft surfaces. De-Icing Systems use heat or chemicals to remove ice that has already formed, ensuring safe flying conditions. Anti-Icing Systems, on the other hand, prevent ice from forming in the first place by continuously applying heat or chemicals to the aircraft surfaces. Both systems are crucial for aviation safety, particularly in cold or icy environments, and play a key role in ensuring the smooth operation of aircraft during adverse weather conditions.</p></p>
