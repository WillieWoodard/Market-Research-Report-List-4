<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Noise External Gear Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Motorless</li><li>Electric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low noise external gear pumps are available in two main types - motorless and electric. Motorless pumps are typically powered by hydraulic or mechanical systems, making them ideal for applications where an external power source is not available or practical. On the other hand, electric gear pumps use an electric motor to drive the pump, providing a more efficient and controlled solution for applications that require precise speed and performance. Both types offer low noise operation, making them suitable for noise-sensitive environments.</p></p>
