<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manual blast cabinets are commonly categorized into two types - Pressure Blast Cabinet and Suction Blast Cabinet. Pressure blast cabinets utilize compressed air to propel abrasive media against the workpiece at high velocity, making them ideal for heavy-duty blasting tasks. On the other hand, suction blast cabinets rely on the suction created by an industrial vacuum to draw abrasive media into the nozzle and onto the workpiece. This type of cabinet is often preferred for lighter applications or when a lower pressure is required. Both types offer versatility and efficiency in surface preparation and finishing processes.</p></p>
