<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-tied microgrids are connected to the main electrical grid and can import or export electricity to and from the grid. This type of market allows for greater flexibility and reliability, as grid-tied microgrids can rely on the main grid for additional power when needed. Independent microgrids, on the other hand, operate completely separate from the main grid and generate their own electricity through renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines. This market type offers greater energy independence and resilience in the face of grid outages or disruptions.</p></p>
