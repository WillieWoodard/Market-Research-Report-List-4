<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing Oil-Fired Furnace</li><li>Oil Fired Indirect Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil furnace market types include condensing oil-fired furnace and oil-fired indirect heater. Condensing oil-fired furnaces are high-efficiency systems that extract heat from the exhaust gases, resulting in lower fuel consumption and operating costs. On the other hand, oil-fired indirect heaters provide a more indirect method of heating by using a heat exchanger to transfer heat to a separate fluid. Both types of systems offer efficient and effective ways to heat homes and buildings using oil as a fuel source.</p></p>
