<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Osmium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Osmium sputtering targets can be categorized into two main types: rotary type and non-rotatable type. Rotary type targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process to ensure uniform coating, making them ideal for large area deposition. Non-rotatable targets, on the other hand, are stationary and are commonly used for smaller areas or when rotating is not necessary. Both types cater to different sputtering requirements and are utilized in various industries such as electronics, aerospace, and optics.</p></p>
