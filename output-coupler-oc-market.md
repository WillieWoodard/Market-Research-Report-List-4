<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Output Coupler (OC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane</li><li>Concave and Convex</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Output Coupler (OC) refers to a component in lasers that selectively allows some light to exit the system while reflecting the rest back into the laser cavity. There are three main types of OC markets: Plane, Concave, and Convex. Plane OCs are flat mirrors that reflect light at a 90-degree angle. Concave OCs curve inward, focusing the beam. Convex OCs curve outward, causing the beam to diverge. Each type of OC serves a specific purpose in controlling the output of lasers for various applications.</p></p>
