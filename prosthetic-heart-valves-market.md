<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Prosthetic heart valves are divided into three main types: Transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are inserted through a catheter and do not require open-heart surgery. Tissue heart valves are made from animal tissue and are durable but may need to be replaced. Mechanical heart valves are made from metal and are long-lasting but require lifelong blood thinners. Each type of prosthetic heart valve has its own advantages and considerations for patients with heart valve disease.</p></p>
