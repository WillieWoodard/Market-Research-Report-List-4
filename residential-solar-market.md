<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied Solar System</li><li>Off Grid Solar System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-tied solar systems are connected to the utility grid and allow homeowners to generate their own electricity while remaining connected to the grid. This allows them to sell excess power back to the grid and benefit from net metering. Off-grid solar systems, on the other hand, operate independently of the utility grid and are typically used in remote locations where connecting to the grid is expensive or not feasible. Homeowners with off-grid systems must rely on batteries to store excess energy for use when the sun is not shining.</p></p>
