<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Dresser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintering Rotary Dresser</li><li>Electroplating Rotary Dresser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary dressers are commonly used in grinding applications to maintain the shape and sharpness of grinding wheels. There are two main types of rotary dressers: sintering rotary dressers and electroplating rotary dressers. Sintering rotary dressers are manufactured using a high-temperature process that bonds diamond or CBN grits to the dresser body. On the other hand, Electroplating rotary dressers use an electroplating process to deposit a layer of diamond or CBN onto the dresser surface. Both types of rotary dressers are essential for maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of grinding processes.</p></p>
