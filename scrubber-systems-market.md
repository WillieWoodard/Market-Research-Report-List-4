<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Technology</li><li>Dry Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scrubber systems market is divided into two main types: wet technology and dry technology. Wet technology scrubbers use a liquid solution to remove pollutants from gas streams, while dry technology scrubbers use a dry sorbent material. Wet technology scrubbers are more commonly used and offer higher removal efficiencies for a wide range of pollutants. Dry technology scrubbers are often preferred for applications where water availability is limited or the pollutants are in a dry form. Both technologies play a crucial role in reducing air emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
