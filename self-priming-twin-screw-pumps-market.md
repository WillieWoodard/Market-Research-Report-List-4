<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-priming Twin Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double-suction Twin-Screw Pump</li><li>Single-suction Twin-Screw Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-priming twin screw pumps are used in various industries for their efficiency and reliability. The market for these pumps can be divided into two main types based on their suction capabilities: double-suction twin-screw pumps and single-suction twin-screw pumps. Double-suction pumps have the ability to draw in liquid from both sides, allowing for higher flow rates and reduced axial thrust. On the other hand, single-suction pumps only take in liquid from one side, making them more suitable for applications with lower flow rates and pressure requirements.</p></p>
