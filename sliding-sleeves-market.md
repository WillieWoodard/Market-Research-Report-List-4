<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sliding Sleeves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open/Close</li><li>Choking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sliding sleeves are used in hydraulic fracturing operations to control the flow of fluids through the wellbore. There are two main types of sliding sleeves: open/close sleeves and choking sleeves. Open/close sleeves allow for the opening or closing of ports to control fluid flow, while choking sleeves have fixed-size ports that restrict the flow rate. By using these different types of sliding sleeves, operators can optimize the wellbore's production and injection rates according to the specific requirements of the well.</p></p>
