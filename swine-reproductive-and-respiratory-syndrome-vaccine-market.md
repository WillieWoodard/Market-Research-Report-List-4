<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active vaccines for Swine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies by introducing a weakened form of the virus. Inactivated vaccines, on the other hand, use a killed version of the virus to trigger the immune response. Active vaccines are more effective in providing long-term immunity but may carry the risk of causing a mild form of the disease. Inactivated vaccines are safer but may require booster doses to maintain protection. Both types play a crucial role in controlling and preventing the spread of the disease in swine populations.</p></p>
