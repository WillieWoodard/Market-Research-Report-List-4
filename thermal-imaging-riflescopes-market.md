<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Imaging Riflescopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Cooled Thermal Imaging</li><li>Cryogenically Cooled Thermal Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal imaging riflescopes are available in two main types: un-cooled thermal imaging and cryogenically cooled thermal imaging. Un-cooled thermal imaging riflescopes use a sensor to detect infrared radiation emitted by objects and create a thermal image without the need for cooling. On the other hand, cryogenically cooled thermal imaging riflescopes use a cooling system to enhance the performance and sensitivity of the sensor, allowing for clearer and more detailed thermal images. Both types of thermal imaging riflescopes have their own advantages and are used in various applications.</p></p>
