<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thickness Gauges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Thickness Gauge</li><li>Non-Contact Thickness Gauge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thickness gauges are used to measure the thickness of materials accurately. There are two main types of thickness gauges on the market: contact thickness gauges and non-contact thickness gauges. </p><p>Contact thickness gauges require physical contact with the material being measured, providing precise measurements but can cause wear and tear on the material. </p><p>Non-contact thickness gauges use sensors to measure the distance between the gauge and the material without touching it, making them ideal for delicate or sensitive materials but may have slightly less accuracy compared to contact gauges.</p></p>
