<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Pre Aligner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Aligner</li><li>Atmosphere Aligner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer pre-aligners are used in semiconductor manufacturing to position wafers accurately before processing. Vacuum aligners use a vacuum to hold wafers in place for alignment, ensuring precise positioning. Atmosphere aligners do the same job but without the use of a vacuum, relying on other methods to secure and align the wafers. Both types of pre-aligners play a crucial role in achieving high accuracy and efficiency in semiconductor production processes.</p></p>
