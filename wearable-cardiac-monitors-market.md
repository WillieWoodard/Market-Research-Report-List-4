<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wearable Cardiac Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Pulse Based</li><li>Optical Technology Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wearable cardiac monitors come in two main types: electric pulse based and optical technology based. Electric pulse based monitors detect cardiac activity through sensors that measure electrical signals produced by the heart. This type of monitor is commonly used in traditional ECG devices. Optical technology based monitors, on the other hand, use light sensors to track blood flow and detect fluctuations in the volume of blood pumped by the heart. Both types of monitors provide continuous and accurate monitoring of cardiac activity.</p></p>
