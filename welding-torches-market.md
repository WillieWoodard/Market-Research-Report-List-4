<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Torches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Welding Torches</li><li>Water-Cooled Welding Torches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air-cooled welding torches are popular for light-duty welding applications due to being more compact, lightweight, and cost-effective. They work by using gas to cool down the torch and prevent overheating. On the other hand, water-cooled welding torches are designed for heavy-duty welding tasks and are more efficient in dissipating heat. They use water as a cooling mechanism, allowing for longer and continuous welding sessions without the risk of overheating. Both types cater to different welding needs and preferences in the market.</p></p>
